## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain customers. This project offers a full-stack solution for predicting customer churn using machine learning classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and an interactive Streamlit UI for making real-time predictions.

## Demo

Provide a link or a screenshot of your deployed Streamlit UI here.

## Features

- User-friendly Streamlit UI for inputting customer data and getting churn predictions.
- Data preprocessing and feature transformation.
- Classification model for predicting customer churn.
- Logging of historical predictions.
- Visualization of historical prediction distribution.
- Optional integration of additional reports or features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites or dependencies users need to install and run your project. Include links to relevant documentation or resources.

- Python (>=3.6)
- Streamlit
